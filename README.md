This portfolio contains labs and board designs related to work done by Haley Basti in ECEN 5730: Practical PCB Design and Manufacture

Board 1 begins with the basics of printed circuit board design, using a 555 timer to create a 50% duty cycle 500 MHz square wave.

Board 2 introduces concepts related to best practices in PCB design by comparing two hex inverters: one over a shared ground plane with decoupling capacitors and short power traces, and one without. 

Board 3 builds on our understanding of best practices in designing a PCB by creating a "Golden Arduino" - an improved version of the original Arduino design.

Other labs included are not related to our board design, but to best practices to utilize in in designing a PCB.
